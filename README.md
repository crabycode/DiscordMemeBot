This is the fourth final project I made for finishing my codedex journey:
"The Legend of Python"<br>
It is a Discord meme bot that gives you an image when you type $meme.<br>
*Update<br>
I made the bot return responses to newcommands featuring:<br>
$lofi - gives a random lofi music video from a lofi playlist!<br>
$roll - rolls from number a(input) to number b(input) and gives you a random number between a and b. <br>
$nicecock - this command is just for the meme, to congratulate the memebot for doing its job as programmed.
